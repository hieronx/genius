GENius
======

GENius is a tool that helps those interested in synthetic biology build a circuit of logical operators to control a biological process. These processes can be modified to gain insight into what would happen if some bricks (logical operators or a circuit) were to be omitted, inserted or modified. This would help researchers to gain insight into possible applications of synthetic biology and students to gain knowledge into how synthetic biology works.
